# authentication strategy.md Document

## Overview

This document outlines the authentication mechanisms used in the SolaceNet Monorepo. It includes details on token-based authentication, OAuth2, and session management.

## Details

- **Token-Based Authentication**: All API endpoints require a valid JWT token.
- **OAuth2**: Used for third-party integrations and user authentication.
- **Session Management**: Secure session cookies are used for web-based interactions.

## Implementation

- Ensure all tokens are signed using HMAC SHA-256.
- Tokens expire after 15 minutes and require refresh tokens for re-authentication.
- OAuth2 flows supported: Authorization Code, Client Credentials.
