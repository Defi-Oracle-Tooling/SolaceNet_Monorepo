# security master plan.md Document

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the SolaceNet Monorepo.

## Details

- **Authentication**: All services use token-based authentication with OAuth2 support.
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC) is enforced across all services.
- **Encryption**: Data is encrypted at rest using AES-256 and in transit using TLS 1.2/1.3.
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Regular scans are conducted using tools like OWASP ZAP.
- **Incident Response**: A detailed incident response plan is in place to handle security breaches.

## Implementation

- Use secure coding practices to prevent common vulnerabilities like SQL injection and XSS.
- Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
- Conduct security audits and penetration testing quarterly.
