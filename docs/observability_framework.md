# observability framework.md Document

## Overview

This document outlines the observability framework for the SolaceNet Monorepo.

## Details

- **Metrics Collection**: Prometheus is used to collect and store metrics from all services.
- **Logging**: Centralized logging is implemented using Elasticsearch and Kibana.
- **Tracing**: Distributed tracing is enabled using Jaeger to track requests across services.
- **Dashboards**: Grafana is used to visualize metrics and logs.

## Implementation

- Instrument services with Prometheus client libraries.
- Configure Elasticsearch and Kibana for centralized logging.
- Integrate Jaeger for distributed tracing.
- Set up Grafana dashboards for real-time monitoring.
