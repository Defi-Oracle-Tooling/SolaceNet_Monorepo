# User-Service Microservice Master Plan

## Overview

The User-Service manages user profiles, preferences, and account settings. It serves as the central repository for user-related data.

## Inputs and Outputs

- **Inputs**: User registration data, profile updates.
- **Outputs**: User profile details, account status.

## API Contracts

- **POST /users**: Create a new user account.
- **GET /users/{id}**: Retrieve user profile by ID.
- **PUT /users/{id}**: Update user profile.

## Database Models

- **User**: Stores user details such as name, email, and preferences.
- **Preferences**: Stores user-specific settings.

## Business Logic

- Validate user input during registration and updates.
- Ensure data consistency across related entities.
- Provide APIs for querying and updating user data.

## Dependencies

- **Internal services**: Auth-Service for authentication.
- **External APIs**: Email verification services.

## Security

- Data encryption at rest and in transit.
- Input validation to prevent SQL injection.
- Access control to restrict unauthorized updates.

## Scaling Plan

- Horizontal scaling with database sharding.
- Implement caching for frequently accessed user data.
