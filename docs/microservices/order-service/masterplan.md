# Order-Service Microservice Master Plan

## Overview

The Order-Service manages order creation, updates, and tracking. It ensures seamless order processing and integration with inventory and payment services.

## Inputs and Outputs

- **Inputs**: Order details, payment confirmation.
- **Outputs**: Order status, tracking information.

## API Contracts

- **POST /orders**: Create a new order.
- **GET /orders/{id}**: Retrieve order details by ID.
- **PUT /orders/{id}**: Update order status.

## Database Models

- **Order**: Stores order details such as items, quantities, and status.
- **OrderItem**: Tracks individual items within an order.

## Business Logic

- Validate order details and ensure inventory availability.
- Update order status based on payment and shipping updates.
- Provide APIs for querying and updating order data.

## Dependencies

- **Internal services**: Inventory-Service for stock validation, Payment-Service for payment confirmation.
- **External APIs**: Shipping providers for tracking.

## Security

- Data encryption at rest and in transit.
- Input validation to prevent SQL injection.
- Role-based access control for order management.

## Scaling Plan

- Horizontal scaling with database partitioning.
- Use message queues for order processing workflows.
