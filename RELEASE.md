## ðŸš€ How to Create a Release

### 1. Create a New Release Branch

```bash
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout -b release/vX.Y.Z
```

### 2. Test the Release

Run all tests to ensure the release is stable:

```bash
npm test
```

### 3. Tag the Release

Create a new tag for the release:

```bash
git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release vX.Y.Z"
git push origin vX.Y.Z
```

### 4. Publish the Release

Push the release branch to the repository:

```bash
git push origin release/vX.Y.Z
```

Create a new release in the GitHub repository, including release notes and a changelog.
